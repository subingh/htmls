		<h2>Pizza</h2>
		<!--add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much-->
		<p>Pizza is the greatest cuisine in the world and my favorite food. I‚Äôd like to believe a majority of the world has had a pizza in some way or form. First, let‚Äôs focus on the taste. Depending on the toppings you choose, pizza can differentiate for everyone. It can be spicy if you add jalapenos, or choose to spread some red peppers over it. It‚Äôs hot, and succulent at the same time. It‚Äôs truly a wonderful taste when you take that first bite, and al the flavors of the sauce, cheese, and seasoning go rushing towards your taste buds. Second thing, the sound pizza makes. That crunchy sound you hear when biting into that delicious seasoned crust. It‚Äôs like heaven on earth. Another thing that‚Äôs great about pizza is how it feels. It has a smooth exterior if done properly. It can also be gooey, and the bread is nice and crusty. Look is also an important factor. Just staring at an ad from Domino‚Äôs or Round Table gives me the urge to grab the phone and place a big order. One of the great things that make pizza look amazing and also makes my mouth water is of course the toppings and cheese. The pepperonis, jalapenos, ham, sausage, etc. They all make pizza unique in it‚Äôs own way, but still gives it that awe-inspiring look and heavenly taste. And sure, every pizza is greasy to some extent, but it‚Äôs still tasty. One final thing to take into consideration is the smell. It‚Äôs compelling, and a smell most people around the world know of. When being baked, you can get a whiff of the melting mozzarella cheese, or sauce. It‚Äôs an enticing odor. Pizza has many scents that will have people lined up craving a slice or more. In conclusion, this is why pizza is the greatest cuisine in the world and my favorite food.</p>

		<p>The pizza itself looks so yummy, crispy and so cheesy. There is no better feeling in the world than a warm pizza box on your lap. My love for Pizza is very high. I am always hungry for pizza, be it any time of the day. Cheese is the secret ingredient of any food it makes any food taste yummy. Nearly any ingredient can be put on pizza. Those diced vegetables, jalapenos, tomato sauce, cheese and mushrooms make me eat more and more like a unique work of art. Every pie is a different shape and size. There are thin-crust pies, deep dish pies, and everything in between. There are pies with different cheeses and tomato sauce, or even pies with a completely different base altogether. On every occasion, I celebrate it with pizza style. There are times when I get scolded for having a pizza all the time because anything in excess causes harms to our health but a pizza lover will always be a pizza lover. There is something between me and pizza the bond which cannot be broken.</p>
